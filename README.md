# Two Pin Through Hole Push Button

Harry Boyd - hboyd255@gmail.com - 20/05/2024

This is a KiCad library for the common 6x6x5mm momentary push button with two
pins. The footprint is a through hole design with a 2.54mm pitch.


## Setup

To get the library working, you need to add path of this repository to the KiCad
library search path. This can be done by going to
`Preferences -> Configure Paths` and adding the path with the name
`Two_Pin_Through_Hole_Push_Button`.

## Dimensions

The dimensions are based on this image, that I found on
[amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/DAOKAI-WE-DA-046-P-Tactile-Tact-Button/dp/B09WVDCJVB?th=1).
